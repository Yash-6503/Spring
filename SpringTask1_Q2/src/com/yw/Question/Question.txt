Q2)

You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that generates a wish message based on the current time of day using setter-based dependency injection. The application should use LocalDateTime to determine whether to send a "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", or "Good Evening" message.

Requirements:
WishMessageGenerator Class:
Create a WishMessageGenerator class with the following attributes:
LocalDateTime currentDateTime: This will store the current date and time.
Implement a setter method for currentDateTime to allow for dependency injection using Spring.

Implement a generateWishMessage() method that returns:
"Good Morning" if the time is before 12 PM.
"Good Afternoon" if the time is between 12 PM and 6 PM.
"Good Evening" if the time is after 6 PM.

Note:
------
Use Xml file to configure Spring bean.


Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the WishMessageGenerator bean, and prints the wish message based on the current time.

Expected Output:
If the current time is before 12 PM:
	Good Morning
If the current time is between 12 PM and 6 PM:
	Good Afternoon
If the current time is after 6 PM:
	Good Evening
