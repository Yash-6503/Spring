Q1)
You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that prints the current date using setter-based dependency injection. The application will make use of LocalDate (a predefined class in Java) to demonstrate the setter injection of a LocalDate object.

Requirements:
DatePrinter Class:
Create a DatePrinter class with the following attributes:
LocalDate currentDate: This will store the current date.
Implement a setter method setCurrentDate(LocalDate currentDate) to allow for dependency injection using Spring.
Implement a printDate() method that prints the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

Note:
------
Use Xml file to configure Spring bean.

Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the DatePrinter bean, and call printDate().
